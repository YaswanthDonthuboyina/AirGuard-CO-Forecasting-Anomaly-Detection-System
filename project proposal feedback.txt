Feedback: Here is my feedback:

Please use a multi-fold validation approach (3-fold or 5-fold).
Model Evaluation:
Test Set #1 (In-Distribution Samples): Use the actual test examples.
Test Set #2 (Out-of-Distribution Samples): Create an additional test set by adding noise to the original test examples or by generating random samples.
Evaluate your models on both test sets.
Develop a system that can automatically detect OOD examples and remove them before running the classifier.
You must provide statistical validation of your results.
